## Contributing

Any changes to this project must be made through a pull request to `main`. Major
changes should be linked to an
existing [GitHub issue](https://github.com/solarwinds/apm-go/issues).
Smaller contributions like typo corrections don't require an issue.

A PR is ready to merge when all tests pass, any major feedback has been
resolved, and at least one SolarWinds maintainer has approved. Once ready, a PR
can be merged by a SolarWinds maintainer.

## Development

### Prerequisites

* Go (see supported versions in [README.md](README.md))
* openssl

Run tests with `make testfast` which will only run the tests with related 
changes since the last run.

Run all tests with `make test`.

### Formatting and Linting

We enforce the following in CI:

* [`golangci-lint run`](https://golangci-lint.run/)

Please run these locally to assure your PRs do not cause checks to fail.
